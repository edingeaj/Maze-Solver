# Maze-Solver
A program for solving mazes using various searching techniques

 The loadMaze method prompts the user for the path and filename of the maze
puzzle, formatted as a .txt, to be solved and loads and converts the .txt
file into a maze object. The .txt file should be formatted as follows: The
first line of the file contains two integers N and M, separated by a space,
respectively representing the height and width of the maze. Following the
first line are lines of periods, separated by spaces, with each line
separated by empty lines. Sheffer strokes and hyphens separating periods
horizontally and vertically represent the 'walls' of the maze. The starting
position is indicated by an 'S', and the goal is indicated by an 'F'. 

 This repository contains 9 sample maze text files for example and testing purposes.
